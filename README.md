# United Way (Houston) Impact Calculator 

Our application is a donation impact calculator for the United Way of Greater Houston. The application caters to two primary user groups: general audiene and the United Way organization employees. 

For the general audience, the donation impact calculator allows you to visualize what your donations could make an impact on based on the most recent United Way donation distribution data. For the United Way employees, they can visit the admin page to update the donation-to-cause distribution ratio, which will reflect to this github repository's `public/data.json` file.
